# Homework 4 - Reflection

Design:
 1. Looking at different design methods wasn't something that I stuck with consistently throughout the project, but it acted as a good basis for where to start.
 2. The most difficult part of the project was the researching and fiuguring out how to work with Discord bots as I had never done it before, and I still cannot say I am entirely proficient.
 3. In the future I might try to pay attention and follow a specific design method all the way through rather than just loosely follow it at the start.

Implementation:
 1. The most helpful part of testing and implementation in my opinion was making use of the Live Share feature so that we could constantly review each other's code in real time.
 2. The most difficult part was working with other people on code using functionality I wasn't familiar with as it can be hard to tell what someone else's code does when you aren't very familiar with it.
 3. In the future I would like to try and fix issues with the changing API key so we could make better use of Github's branch feature for testing.

Process:
 1. While we admittedly didn't make use of the kanban board during development of the project due to almost all work being done in person with live discussions, after using one for SSW-322, they are very beneficial to organization.
 2. The most difficult part for me was organizing meeting times since we worked in person but I am a commuter student living roughly 2 hours away in Queens, New York. This meant that meetings would usually occur when I was already on campus for other classes.
 3. In the future I would like to look deeper into making discord bots as this one was relatively simple, but there seems to be a lot more you can do with the tools available, and I would like to see the extent of it.
